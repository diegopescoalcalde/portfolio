        "**More than 450000 people have already died of COVID-19 in the world until today (June 29th, 2020).** The pandemic outbreak will surely be part of History classes in the future, just as the bubonic plague and the influenza ones. What makes COVID-19 different from the other public health crisis is that it is the first worldwide pandemic to happen in the generation of high speed communication. Using the appropriate equipment, scientists were able to map different aspects of the virus structure and transmission very fast. They were able to share information from different places of the world using the internet, and work together to come up with ideas and solutions to the impacts of the disease. Not only that, governments are able to monitor in real time the numbers and make decisions based in data. I cannot think of any other pandemic crisis that generated more information than this one. For more than 6 months it is the most discussed topic in the entire world and it will still be for at least a couple more.\n",
        "\n",
        "So after seeing many different news showing all sorts of numbers, graphs and forecasts for the disease transmission and its impacts, I decided to create a dashboard to monitor the situation in different countries and come up with my own theories and conclusions. \n",

        "\n",
        "Another important point: Since the data available here comes from different sources with different measurements (countries' governments), I restricted my analysis to a graphical visualization and did not create models or regressions of data. There are too many sources of variation that can influence the model and the predictions.\n",

        "By seeing the slope of the curves here, it is possible to see how sudden was the pandemic impact in the US. In one month the total reported deaths per million changed from 12 to 190. In Brazil the slope was smaller, but it is still in an increasing trend. The trend is different from other countries where the outbreak was more severe, and could be caused by an earlier lockdown or subnotification in the first weeks. If slopes do not change in less than one month Brazil will be the country with the highest number of deaths per million people among the ones that we are looking at."

        "In order to get some insights and verify theories about COVID-19 crisis I created a dashboard where we can monitor the status of cases, deaths and tests using the data from Our World in Data. To give an example of the sort of analysis that can be done with the material I compared the situation of countries with more than 200 million habitants. The disparity of the numbers is evident and shows how many questions and theories can come from a quick data visualization exercise. Some of the important conclusions are:\n",
        "\n",
        "* United States and Brazil are in a whole different level of cases and deaths than the other countries, what makes me think think of two questions. The first, is this the real situation of the other countries or a strong subnotification issue? And the second, if the data is right, what did United States and Brazil did so differently from these countries to face the issue in a different scale?\n",
        "* The number of cases in the United States can be explained by the much bigger scale in which tests are being done there when compared to any other country of our list. United States started increasing the number of tests per thousand habitants in April, when the number of deaths started rising, but it was too late to avoid the more of 100,000 deaths reported so far. There was a clear change of mindset in government that is helping to avoid a far worse situation there.\n",
        "* According to data of public health ministry, Brazil has distributed around 10 million tests, what puts it close to the numbers of India and Pakistan in tests per thousand habitants, so Brazil has not tested more than these other countries (more data available in Portuguese [here](https://www.saude.gov.br/noticias/agencia-saude/47113-saude-passa-a-testar-100-dos-casos-leves-de-covid-19) and [here](https://covid.saude.gov.br/)). So the number of cases and deaths in Brazil is extremely concerning and the causes must be investigated. \n",
        "* Another point widely discussed is if the virus transmission is higher in poor places. Using the extreme poverty as an indicator of countries that have more or less poor population, that theory does not seem so easy to validate, and India is the main example of that. I will not be naive and pretend that subnotification is not huge in poor places, however the numbers of deaths (which are more easily reported) seem to be much bigger in places where the population is older or where governments openly started taking measures late. [This material](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/28/india/india-coronavirus-outbreak-explained-intl-hnk/index.html) discuss some theories of why the numbers in India are small, which can be very helpful in this comparison.\n",

        "\n",
        "It is important to state that this dataset is not a source of truth. It relies on data governments share with the global organizations, so before any of the conclusions written above can be considered valid, a fact-check process needs to be done to understand if governments are collecting and reporting this data in a similar manner. That does not mean that nothing can be done with the material. Data is the most powerful way to tackle a problem, and helps us to understand where to look at. Studies have to be done in iterative way, in which every dataset helps to narrow down the problem a little bit more, until final answers are found. I hope this material can help as a first step for other studies about this topic, and that we can really consolidate all the available information to avoid a similar crisis in the future.\n",
